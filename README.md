# Purpose
The anabas.pl script could be used to compute statistics
from the files produced by the F5B competition scoring
program of Gernot Fink.

# Very short "How to"
Change to the directory that has been used by the scoring
program for the competition.

Copy everything from the anabas directory to this directory.

Remove any file for "ghost" competitor like st0.txt.

Execute "perl anabas.pl".

Move all "*.html" files to a new directory suitable for publication.

More sophisticated usage is possible: read the code.
